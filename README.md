# Data-Science-bicyle-sharing-project


In this project, we worked in group with a bike-sharing dataset to explore usage patterns and make predictions. After cleaning the data by removing unnecessary columns and creating new variables, we grouped the data by time-related features to calculate average counts. Using a Random Forest Regressor, we built a model to predict bike-sharing demand and evaluated its accuracy with an RÂ² score. Along the way, we used visualizations with Seaborn and Plotly to uncover trends and better understand the data.
